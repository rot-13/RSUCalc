# RSU tax implications calculator

This web page calculates the tax implications of selling RSUs belonging to people paying income tax in Israel.

## TODO

1. Better date entering fields
1. Find api for current (today's) market prices (quandle only gives the closing prices)
1. Handle erroneous response from Qundle (display a user-friendly message about the api usage) 

## Feedback from alpha

1. Add explanation about how the calculation was made
1. Add explanation about trustee fees
1. Add explanation (tooltip) about the input fields and why they are needed (e.g grant date)
1. Add disclaimer (that I am not an accountant)
